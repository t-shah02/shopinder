        <p>Hello, I'm currently a 2nd Year student at UWO. I'm highly passionate about web technologies, and computer science in general.  My favourite programming language is Go. I was really disappointed when my teammates suggested a python project, but I'm glad I went with it. I really enjoyed creating a web application with Tony and Tanish.  I have learned so much about the web through working on this project, and I hope to apply some of the lessons I've learned here elsewhere. 
     One of the biggest issues I dealt with, were the state changes and side effects associated with our project. This has made me a lot more interested in the functional programming paradigm!</p>

        <h4>Simon Fraser University | 2nd Year | Data Science </h4>
        <p>Hello world, my name is Tanish Shah. I am currently a data science student in second year, with an avid interest in developing new software projects. Prior to this Hackathon, I didn't have much of a background in designing web applications. After working through this project with River and Tony, I can proudly say that I have learned a lot about back end and front end development, and how both sides communicate with each other. I discovered that my strengths were in back end development, as it seemed like more of a logical process to me, and I found the idea of handling post/get requests and sending information from  a database to the front-end of a website page very intuitive. This short project has also helped me become better at collaborating with my peers in a software context and I learned important time management skills on writing large amounts of code on time. </p>

        <h4>University of British Columbia | 2nd year | Computer Engineering</h4>
        <p>Hi, my name is Tony Liu, and I am a computer engineering student with a strong passion for software development, hoping to further specialize in that area. I recognize that it will be a long road ahead for me, with plenty to learn. Going into this hackathon, I knew almost nothing about web development. Building UniMeetups had its fair share of challenges, from learning new technology stacks to testing the many possible states and functions of the application. However, with these challenges come opportunity. In the course of less than 24 hours of working on UniMeetups with River and Tanish, I have learned a lot about developing full stack web applications. It was really intriguing to dive down into the nitty gritty of how these applications worked, and truly appreciate all the technologies and frameworks that go into making them function. I am looking forward to continue developing the application, and realize the potential of it.</p>
